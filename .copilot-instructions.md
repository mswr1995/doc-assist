# DocAssist - Copilot Instructions

## Project Overview
DocAssist is a backend-only intelligent document assistant. It allows users to upload documents and then ask questions about their content. The system answers by searching the uploaded documents and always cites the source of its information. This project is designed for learning, with a focus on building and understanding each component step by step.

## Current Progress
- Project structure with modular architecture (completed)
- Basic document utilities - save, read, list (completed)
- Docker containerization setup (completed)
- UV dependency management (completed)
- Text processing utilities (in progress)
- Vector store integration - ChromaDB (pending)
- LLM integration - Ollama (pending)
- FastAPI endpoints (pending)

## Tech Stack
- **Python 3.12** with UV for dependency management
- **FastAPI** for API endpoints
- **ChromaDB** for vector storage
- **Ollama** for local LLM
- **Docker** for containerization
- **Pytest** for testing

## Key Objectives
- **Backend only:** No frontend development; all interactions are via API.
- **Free tools:** Use only open-source or free solutions. No paid APIs or GPU requirements.
- **Learning-focused:** Build incrementally, explaining and understanding each step.
- **Anti-hallucination:** Answers must be based strictly on uploaded documents, with clear source citations.
- **Modular architecture:** Clean separation of concerns for maintainability.
