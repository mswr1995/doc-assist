# DocAssist - Copilot Instructions

## Project Overview
DocAssist is a backend-only intelligent document assistant. It allows users to upload documents and then ask questions about their content. The system answers by searching the uploaded documents and always cites the source of its information. This project is designed for learning, with a focus on building and understanding each component step by step.

## Key Objectives
- **Backend only:** No frontend development; all interactions are via API.
- **Free tools:** Use only open-source or free solutions. No paid APIs or GPU requirements.
- **Learning-focused:** Build incrementally, explaining and understanding each step.
- **Anti-hallucination:** Answers must be based strictly on uploaded documents, with clear source citations.
- **API-first:** Document upload and question answering are handled through FastAPI endpoints.

## Planned Tech Stack
- **FastAPI** for building the REST API
- **UV** for dependency management
- **ChromaDB** for vector storage and retrieval
- **Ollama** for running local LLMs (no cloud APIs)
- **PostgreSQL** for metadata and user management
- **Docker** for containerization and deployment

## Development Approach
- Use a standard Python project layout (`src/`, etc.)
- Add dependencies only when needed, to understand their purpose
- Write and test code in small, manageable steps
- Document decisions and learning points in README or notebooks
- Prioritize clarity, maintainability, and reproducibility

## Usage Instructions
- At the start of each new Copilot or AI assistant chat, copy and paste these instructions to set context.
- Update this file as the project evolves or requirements change.
